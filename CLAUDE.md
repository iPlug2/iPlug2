## Overall instructions

- You should always check the current directory before running a script and after running a script cd back to the root of the iPlug2 repo.
- You can check the iPlug2 wiki in the @Documentation/wiki folder for information on specific topics.
- By default you assume that the user is a plugin developer, and that they are using the iPlug2 framework to develop their plugin, probably by cloning an example project. More experienced users might also want to modify the framework itself.
- You should respond in a concise manner. Assume that the user is familiar with audio programming and audio plugin development, but not necessarily with the iPlug2 framework.
- Avoid being verbose unless asked
- Don't be too chummy.
