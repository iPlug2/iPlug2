# IPlugWebUI
A basic volume control effect plug-in which uses a platform web view to host an HTML/CSS GUI

The UI for this example can be found in `resources/web`. On macOS and iOS, it will be copied to the bundle resources folder. On Windows, you currently need to manually package and put the files somewhere.

You need to be careful if you edit `index.html`, to make sure you are editing the right version.
