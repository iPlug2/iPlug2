These examples all serve as templates, which can be duplicated to form the start of your project.

There are three examples you should check out first:

* **IPlugEffect** : A basic audio effect which is a volume control.
* **IPlugInstrument** : An MPE-capable polyphonic synthesiser.
* **IPlugControls** : A demonstration of the widgets available in the IControls library.

The following examples are more specialized:

* **IPlugChunks** : Shows how to store data other than just parameter values in the plug-in state and how to get tempo info from the host.
* **IPlugMidiEffect** : A basic MIDI effect plugin. Note: only AudioUnits really have a notion of a midi effect.
* **IPlugSideChain** : Demonstrates how to do a plug-in with two input buses for effects that require sidechain inputs such as compressors/gates.
* **IPlugSurroundEffect** : A  multichannel volume control effect plug-in that should work on different surround buses.
* **IPlugDrumSynth** : A drum synthesiser example with multiple output buses.
* **IPlugResponsiveUI** : An example of how to make a responsive UI that adapts to the platform window that can be maximized and resized using the OS window chrome. 
* **IPlugOSCEditor** : Demonstrates how to use the Open Sound Control classes in iPlug2, as well as the IWebViewControl
* **IPlugReaperExtension** : This is a template project for making a [Reaper Extension](http://reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/plugin.php). No realtime audio processing code, obviously. Making a reaper extension can be painful since it is all based around the Win32 APIs. This abstracts away some of the nastyness.
* **IPlugReaperPlugin** : This is a plugin that calls [Reaper Reascript API](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascripthelp.html#c) functions. Supports VST2, VST3 and CLAP formats. Also allows embedded UIs.
* **IPlugConvoEngine** : UI-less example of WDL_ConvoEngine that reports a delay to the host for plugin-delay-compensation (PDC)
* **IPlugVisualizer** : Demonstrates visualizing audio signals.

* **IPlugCocoaUI** : An iOS/macOS project using AppKit/UIKit for the user interface 
* **IPlugSwiftUI** : An iOS/macOS only project using SwiftUI for the user interface
* **IPlugMetalCppUI** : An iOS/macOS project using Metal-cpp for the user interface
* **IPlugWebUI** : An example showing how UI can written in HTML/CSS/JS, using a platform web view
* **IPlugP5js** : Another platform web view project this time using p5js to render using WebGL
* **IPlugSvelteUI** : An example showing how to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to build the UI.
