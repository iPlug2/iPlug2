## CHOC: licensing

I'd like anyone to feel able to use this library code without worrying about the legal implications, so it's released under the permissive ISC license:

----

Note that if you use the `choc::webview::WebView` class on Windows, it embeds some Microsoft redistributable code which has its own (permissive) license that you should be aware of. See inside the file `choc_WebView.h` for more details.
