v1.0.9: (30 April 2009)
- added #ifdef AVOID_TIMESTAMPING to conditionally compile support for event timestamping of ALSA sequencer events. This is useful for programs not needing timestamps, saving valuable system resources.
- updated functionality in OSX_CORE for getting driver name (thanks to Casey Tucker)

v1.0.8: (29 January 2009)
