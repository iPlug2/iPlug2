# macOS

  - You need to modify the AAXlibrary project in order to compile with the same SDK as your plug-ins

  - set SDKROOT to macosx10.x for debug and release targets of AAXLibrary static lib
 
  - modify ExamplePlugIns/Common/Mac/CommonDebugSettings.xcconfig and ExamplePlugIns/Common/Mac/CommonReleaseSettings.xcconfig...

  GCC_VERSION = com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang  
  SDKROOT = macosx10.X  
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.X  
  ARCHS = x86_64  

On Windows you will need to set the Libs/AAXLibrary/WinBuild/AAXLibrary.vcxproj project to link statically to the MSVC runtime library - change to /MT rather than /MD
