Here are some instructions for a good PR

* [create an issue](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/new/choose) first to outline the problem, to reference in this PR
* clearly describe the problem that the PR fixes
* each PR should address one thing. It can include multiple commits, but you should try and tidy up work done into logical units if possible.
* pay attention to [iplug2 coding style](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/blob/master/Documentation/codingstyle.md)
* If it applies to an option e.g. IGRAPHICS_NANOVG or VST3 plug-ins, try to provide fixes for all options (e.g. all graphics backends or all plug-in formats)

If you follow these rules, it is more likely we will consider your PR, but please don't be upset if we decide we don't want to merge your work.

thanks, we like PRs!
