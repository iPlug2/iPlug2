WDL / IPlug - Oli Larkin Edition

IPlug is a simple-to-use C++ framework for developing cross platform audio plugins and targeting multiple plugin APIs with the same code. Originally developed by Schwa/Cockos, IPlug has been enhanced by various contributors. IPlug depends on WDL, and that is why this project is called WDL-OL,  although most of the differences from Cockos' WDL are to do with IPlug.
This version of IPlug targets VST2, VST3, AudioUnit RTAS and AAX (Native) APIs. It can also produce standalone Windows/OSX audio/midi apps and apps for Apple's IOS devices. 

This version of WDL/IPlug shares the same license as the Cockos edition. Several of the added features are based on the work of other people. See individual source code files for any extra license information.
