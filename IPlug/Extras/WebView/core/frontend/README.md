This folder should contain core frontend web content that are automatically supplied by iPlug2 regardless of what the user web content is.

For example, the `iPlug2.js` in `Resources/web` should automatically be loaded in every web view so that the developer can get easy access to core iPlug2 features by Calling `iPlug2.someFunction()` in their frontend code.
