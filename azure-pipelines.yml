# Also installs various secure dependencies such as the VST2 and AAX SDKs. This will require editing if you have not set those secure files in Azure pipelines.
# If build_deps == false, downloads optional pre-built dependencies IPLUG2_DEPS_MAC and IPLUG2_DEPS_WIN, unzips them in the src tree
# Creates an artifact 'SRC' containing a populated iPlug 2 folder heirarchy
