# iPlug 2

iPlug 2 is a simple-to-use C++ framework for developing cross platform audio plug-ins/apps and targeting multiple plug-in APIs with the same minimalistic code. The original version of iPlug was developed by [John Schwartz aka schwa](https://www.cockos.com/team.php) and released in 2008 as part of Cockos' WDL library. iPlug 2 (2018) is a substantial reworking that brings multiple vector graphics backends (including GPU accelerated options and HiDPI/scaling), support for distributed plug-in formats and compiling to WebAssembly, amongst many other things.

iPlug 2 targets the VST2, VST3, AudioUnit and AAX (Native) and the [Web Audio Module](https://webaudiomodules.org) (WAM) plug-in APIs. It can also produce standalone win32/macOS apps with audio and MIDI I/O, and [Reaper](https://reaper.fm) extensions.

iPlug 2 includes support for [the FAUST programming language](http://faust.grame.fr), and the libfaust JIT compiler. It was the winner of the 2018 FAUST award.
